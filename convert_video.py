# To convert an MP4 video file to MP3 audio file, we would typically use a library like moviepy.
# However, since the user has not provided an MP4 file to convert, we'll demonstrate the code
# that could be used to perform this conversion if a file were provided.

# Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how this conversion might work:

from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip
from pydub import AudioSegment


# The code assumes that an MP4 file named 'input_video.mp4' is available in the current directory.
# The output will be an MP3 file named 'output_audio.mp3'.

# Function to convert MP4 to MP3
def convert_mp4_to_mp3(input_video_path, output_audio_path):
    # Load the video file
    video = VideoFileClip(input_video_path)
    # Extract audio from the video file
    audio = video.audio
    # Write the audio to a file
    audio.write_audiofile(output_audio_path, codec='mp3')


# Example usage:
# convert_mp4_to_mp3('input_video.mp4', 'output_audio.mp3')

# This code will not be executed here because there's no MP4 file provided.
# The function is ready to use for when a file is available.

# Uncomment and modify the following line if an MP4 file is uploaded:
# convert_mp4_to_mp3('/path/to/your/video.mp4', '/mnt/data/output_audio.mp3')

# As of now, I'm providing this as a reference. If you upload an MP4 file, I can execute this code to convert it to MP3.
